Load all data in to begin with
Keep the main array intact at all times
Sync operations can just push onto the end (start) of the data array
Tag searches can just return IDs which look up from the main array when clicked
Edit operations will load tags and desc using fresh AJAX call
Navigating direct to a large image should load image data server-side, show it inmmediately,
then load main data array and figure out which page to show in the background
